# Libft-tests
A rigorous test for 42's libft assignment.


	This test requires you to read it to understand it's output. It's worth it though as it catches a few things the others don't.
	obviously use it in conjunction with other tests as this is not exhaustive.
	If you have an issue with the difficulty to use this test remember that 42 rewards critical thinking and initiative. 
	If you still disagree with my methodology then poc or gtfo
